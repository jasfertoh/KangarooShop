    Which programming language is often seen as a badge of honor among software developers?  C++

    Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume,  will often get you a job interview?  C++

    Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years?  C++

    Why you should learn C++

    Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years.

    Not only is C++ popular, but it is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.

    There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++. These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!

    Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator,  the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.

    Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.

    Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?

    If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers.

    But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++  is because it is so powerful!

    What do I mean by powerful?

    C++ is super fast and is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.

    It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.

    C++ can do many things that other languages just can't.

    That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.

    Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.

    How can a beginner learn C++?

    Find a good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language.

    Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses.  He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry.

    So not only will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taught at university level for many years.

    As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.

    Which version of C++ should I learn?

    C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years.  It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.

    Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17).

    Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.

    What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well?

    This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20.

    C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14.    So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it.

    It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time.

    What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course.

    It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++.

    And even if you really do want to learn C++20,  the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++.

    If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++.

    Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course!

    Is C++ difficult to learn?

    With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.

    There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.

    But with the right instructor and the right training, you really can get up to speed with C++ quickly, and that's what this course is all about.

    What will I learn in this course?

    The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++.

    Key topics covered include.

    * Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion
    * Performing calculations and displaying results
    * Functions
    * Pointers
    * Using existing classes and creating objects
    * Creating your own classes
    * Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector
    * Constructors and Destructors
    * Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment
    * How to overload operators
    * Using inheritance and class hierarchies
    * Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding
    * Using smart pointers
    * Using stream I/O
    * An introduction to the C++ STL
    * An introduction to Exception Handling
    * And much more.


    How is this C++ course different from other courses?

    You will learn Modern C++, for one.  Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.  If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.

    The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations.

    You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as your instructor Frank has.

    What do I get out of learning C++?

    More career options for one!  C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development.    It's also heavily used in embedded applications.  Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!

    Flutter - a framework developed by Google - allows you to learn one language (Dart) and build beautiful native mobile apps in no time. Flutter is a SDK providing the tooling to compile Dart code into native code and it also gives you a rich set of pre-built and pre-styled UI elements (so called widgets) which you can use to compose your user interfaces.

    Flutter is extremely trending and gets used for major Google apps like their Adwords app - it's now marked as "ready for production", hence now is the time to jump in and learn it!

    This course will teach Flutter & Dart from scratch, NO prior knowledge of either of the two is required! And you certainly don't need any Android or iOS development experience since the whole idea behind Flutter is to only learn one language.

    You'll learn Flutter not only in theory but we'll build a complete, realistic app throughout this course. This app will feature both all the core basics as well as advanced features like using Google Maps, the device camera, adding animations and more!

    With Flutter, you'll be able to write code only once and ship your apps both to the Apple AppStore and Google Play.

    Use Google's Material Design to build beautiful, yet fully customizable, apps in no time with almost zero effort. You can use the rich widget suite Flutter provides to add common UI elements like buttons, switches, forms, toolbars, lists and more - or you simply build your own widgets - Flutter makes that a breeze, too.

    Here's what's included in the course:

    Detailed setup instructions for both macOS and Windows

    A thorough introduction to Flutter, Dart and the concept behind widgets

    An overview of the built-in widgets and how you may add your own ones

    Wordpress for Beginners - A Complete Guide to Wordpress!

    In 2020, it's never been easier to build a fantastic, responsive website that looks great on computers, tablets, and mobile phones.

    You can learn Wordpress WITHOUT having to buy web hosting or a domain name.  I'll show you how you can set it all up on your own computer using free tools.

    NOTE: This course will always be updated to cover the latest version of WordPress.  Covers WordPress 5.0 and earlier.

    The primary goal of this course is to teach anyone, even a complete beginner, how to become a Wordpress guru in a few short hours, without lots of technical jargon.  I'll guarantee that after taking this course you'll have the knowledge you need to build a responsive, beautiful website with the latest version of Wordpress.  Not only will you know more than 99% of Wordpress users out there, but you'll actually enjoy using Wordpress too.

    About the Course

    This course will guide you through every single step from installation to finished website.  I'll show you how you can install Wordpress on your own computer for free, so you don't have to pay for a domain name or hosting fees while you complete this course.  Once you've got Wordpress installed on your computer, you will learn how to build and run a successful, beautiful, responsive-design website you can be proud of.

    After taking you through all of the main options in Wordpress, explaining what each one does and how you set it up, I'll let you watch over my shoulder as I build a Wordpress website.

    At the start of the course, I'll walk you through setting up Wordpress on your own computer so that you don't need to pay for a web host (or a domain name) while you master wordpress.  When you decide you want to put a website online, you can then watch over-my-shoulder as I buy a domain name and hosting, and install Wordpress online.

    Whether you decide to host your site on your own computer, or at a web host, you'll be ready to start mastering Wordpress.  We'll start at the very beginning by logging in to have a look around to familiarize ourselves with the main areas of the Dashboard.

    Once you are happy navigating around your new tools, we'll go through the main features you will need as you create your site, including:

    The WYSIWYG Editor.  This is where you enter all of your website content.

    The Media Library, to manage your images, videos, sound files and other media you want to share on your site.

    Wordpress Settings, and I'll take you step by step to set those up just right.

    We'll look at the differences between Wordpress posts and pages, and I'll give you a simple way of knowing which one to use on any occasion.

    We'll look at post excerpts, categories and tags, and how to use them on a well-structured site to maximize visitor experience and search engine ranking benefits.

    You'll see the two main ways you can set your homepage up.

    We'll create a contact form on the site so visitors can get in touch.

    We'll setup an About us page, and I'll explain why this page is important and what information to include on it.

    We'll cover the legal pages you need.

    We'll discuss the navigation system on your site, and how you can set up customized navigation in the header, sidebar or footer of your site.  We'll also talk about internal site linking.

    We'll cover Wordpress security, and set up a system that will keep the site safe from hackers.

    We'll check out some great free plugins.

    Finally, I'll give you a 20 step plan for creating your site.

    By the end of this course, you will have a website that you are truly proud of.

    Just of few of the many Student Reviews

    This is a fabulous course, and I would it give it six stars if such a rating were available! Everything is very clearly explained, and Andy promptly answers any question you might have. If you are interested in using and learning WordPress, you owe it to yourself to take this outstanding course. Robert Weiser

    Lectures are well-structured with lots of details given. The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and communicates very effectively. I've been able to set up my first website based on what I've learned here. A definite plus is that questions posted via the course are answered quickly! Susan Worms

    I love this course. I have spent a few hours today and I have already learned so much. Really excited about the potential for when I am done. Great Course! A. Luis Acosta

    I learned a lot more than how to use WordPress in basic terms. Andrew shares a lot of insider knowledge and tips that would take you countless hours of doing your own research to learn...and answering questions you may not have thought to ask. Couldn't have asked for a better course to help me jumpstart into WordPress. Nathaniel Stephens

    What a fantastic share of knowledge. I really appreciated and loved how a "real" site was used for the lectures, real world examples of everything. I would definitely take this course - highly recommended! Glen Schafer

    This course is perfect for people who want to start a blog or info page with wordpress. He covers all the basics and sometimes goes even a little deeper, to give you an idea what to look for. The provided documents are gold and very helpfull. I can't wait to go public with my site. Thank you for the great lectures. Andreas Lackmann

    I really wish I had access to a course such as this four years ago when I first started dabbling with Wordpress as a hobby in my retirement. The learning process at the time, for a non-techy like me, was painstaking. Andy's course was the ideal step-by-step teaching method. I'm now much more confident about starting a new affiliate marketing website. Leon

    Well delivered, well structured. Easy to follow and logical. Developed my own website in parallel with the course, and had it up and running within two weeks of starting. Looking forward to undertaking a couple of the course developers other courses now. Highly recommended. Steve Laing

    Excellent instructor. Andy is great. He used visuals for everything he say. I was able to pause him and go to my site and test my understanding in all areas that I did know. The results and excitement are fantastic. Esau Khan

    A fantastic course. Thank you Andy. This is a great course and it has helped me start to build my own WordPress website. I was very impressed when I had a problem with viewing my site that you took time to check for me. That shows what a great teacher you are. I have booked up another course by to and can't wait for more. Once again. Thank you. B Brown

    Many of the courses I've been through related to learning Wordpress are either too complicated or the author doesn't spend enough time explaining concepts so that you can understand what's being said. Andy strikes a nice balance with this course in that all the modules are broken up into easily digestible pieces. I like that he takes enough time to explain each new concept or module without being repetitive or using jargon that's difficult to follow. I also love being able to follow along with Andy as he explains each new module as well (as opposed to just talking off of slides all the time). He literally walks you through everything, so it's like you're right there looking over his shoulder. For anyone wanting to understand all the fundamentals of Wordpress, I think you'll absolutely love this course. It will save you tons of time by having all this information in one place. And you'll even learn some additional features like setting up affiliate links (not that everyone needs to know this but I like that Andy included it so it's there if you ever want to know). Truly a fantastic course! Lance Gross

    Superb Course - Extraordinary Instructor!! Andy's Wordpress for Beginners-Master Wordpress Quicky course is by far the best Wordpress course I've seen. And I definitely wouldn't say it's just for beginners. I'm not a beginner - I thought I knew Wordpress pretty well, but I learned SO MUCH MORE from this course! I've always had a lot of questions about the many settings and various options in Wordpress and most courses just skip over them or tell you to check this box and move on with no explanation. I never really got my questions answered until now. Andy is very detailed in his instruction. He walks you through step by step and tells you what each setting or section is for, how it is used (or not used) and why. I got more out of Andy's course than any other course I've ever taken. He has an extensive teaching background and it is evident in his clearly produced videos. After taking this course, you'll find your confidence level will soar. Carol

    Well, I'm here to teach you HTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw, step-by-step.

    So, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like Omnifood, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone.

    But what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: to enable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project.



    So, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn:

    The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (www.omnifood.dev). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!

    How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).

    How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs

    How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)

    How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching

    How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons

    Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools

    [02] Why is this course so unique and popular?

    Reason #1: The course is completely project-based

    Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by building actual projects! In the final project (www.omnifood.dev), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a fictional company that I made up just for the course.



    Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code

    Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire 7-step process of building and launching our website project.

    So the huge Omnifood project will teach you real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.

    On top of that, this course has a huge focus on beautiful design. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.



    Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you

    With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be quite easy and fun to learn. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.

    My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.

    Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and designed the ideal course curriculum for every type of student. It's a unique blend of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!



    [03] Why is this course so long?

    Reason #1: I take time to explain every single concept that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (this is a course, not a tutorial)

    Reason #2: I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!

    Reason #3: There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually assimilate and practice what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills
